This model, which we created using a residual network (ResNet) consisting of 50 layers, works with a data set 
in which numbers from 0 to 5, which are shown manually, are presented as data. Therefore, our model classifies 
6 different groups (0,1,2,3,4,5). However, since there was an error in the source from which the data was taken, 
an algorithm was created for the MNIST dataset by editing the codes.
