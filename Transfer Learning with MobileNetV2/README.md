### Transfer Learning Using the MobileNetV2 Algorithm
In this project, we are testing whether a photo is alpaca using the MobileNetV2 algorithm, which has been 
pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. We are trying to group two different classes (alpaca or not alpaca) 
using the weights of this algorithm, which was trained by classifying over 1000 different groups beforehand.
